## [02-Dec-2287] I cleared the corvega factory of raiders for Rob and Elaine Paula, the couple living at Tenpines Bluff. Good lord, did I clear it, though...

* ...It was cathartic. My power armour is unfair, untouchable, and soothing as it chugs along. Chug chug chug chug chug. This is more fun than it should be. Rob and Elaine were surprised when I returned; they don’t know the Chugchug. How could they? They want to push me out of Tenpines now that I handled the raiders for them. They’ve got something else coming. Tenpines Bluff is mine.

* __[04-Dec-2287]__ I need to find more raiders to kill. Preston mentioned some farm. Maybe the old beatnik co-op? Shadepine? Something like that, it’s not a place I’dve gone, before the war. Either way, I should check it out.

* __[05-Dec-2287]__ Fuck fuck fuck what the fuck? The raider and dog corpse over the bridge are fucking messing with me. I threw the bodies over the bridge. Next day, they’re back. I do it again. Back again. Did I throw them over the bridge? Fuck.

* __[06-Dec-2287]__ Sunshine Tidings Co-op. I went there with Mr Handy, and messed up a gang of feral ghouls. I enthusiastically rifle through the pockets of any ghouls I slaughter, now. More often than not, they have trinket or ‘keepsake’ stashed. I wonder if it is a ‘keepsake,’ or just the last thing they had in their hand before they lost their mind completely. Does some vestigially human part of them hold on to it dearly? I think so - otherwise surely I’d find more ghouls without anything. They always have *something*. My heart lifts when I hear that gurgling retch: what will it be this time? A plastic spoon? A toy car? An empty bottle? Such excitement! 

    Codsworth and I found a defective Mr Handy. The beatniks that lived here before the war were some kind of robot liberationist whackjobs, and they’d crossed his wires, remade him as a spaced out ‘Professor Goodfeels’. I tried playing with his control console, but couldn’t get him back to regular operation with inputs alone. Then I noticed coordinates for a maintenance centre, to which it could be dispatched. I did so, figuring I could go there later, and try my hand at fixing him with whatever was left on-site. 

    Sunshine Tidings Co-op is a quality location. It beggars belief that nobody has taken up residence there. Maybe they did; we found a pretty fresh settler corpse whilst clearing out the ghouls. Seems more like a drifter who picked the wrong place to camp, though. Anyway, the site definitely looks like it could be developed as much, if not more so, than Sanctuary. I can see what Preston sees in the place; we’ll camp here tonight.

* __[07-Dec-2287]__ Jackpot; whilst rifling through an abandoned chapel nearby the co-op, I stumbled upon the backdoor to a massive subterranean raider complex. It was carnage, they never prepared to be attacked from behind. Tunnel by tunnel, I painted the walls red. I think Codsworth disapproved. 

    The raiders didn’t even know what was going on until I was at the main entrance, and realised what the facility actually was: a pre-war federal ration stockpile. By then, well over half of them lay dismembered behind me. 

    Holy shit, that didn’t stop Codsworth from nearly dying, though. He rushed out in front of the sandbags, buzzsaw flailing. I froze when I heard a blast and stopped hearing his vocoder. Nearly died myself; I was hyperventilating and rocking when the raiders breached the front of the compound. Codsworth charged in after them, pulling me out of it, thankfully. Bless his spirit, but I can’t take that risk.

* __[08-Dec-2287]__ As we came back from the Sunshine Tidings expedition, we came across the smouldering husk of Professor Goodfeels. I broke down: I killed him. What was I thinking? Sending him to his old maintenance depot, halfway across the Commonwealth Wasteland. Why didn’t I leave him at the Co-op? I could have gone to the maintenance centre and retrieved what I needed to fix him. Now he’s gone. I don’t even know what happened. I already killed the raiders on that bridge, and his chassis was already so damaged by the beatniks I couldn’t make out what did him in. Why did I send him to the depot?

    I’m putting Codsworth in charge of Sanctuary. Someone else can cover my six. Dogmeat, maybe? I don’t know, is a dog enough? I’d have to train him. Preston Garvey? Gah, I hate that guy. Rainbow Jane? No, too valuable. Maybe I should roll solo…


* __[10-Dec-2287]__ Enough. That’s the last straw. I pulverised the raider and the dog into a fine paste across the bitumen with shotgun, a baseball bat, and my bare hands. Sticky Joe and Dogpaste! Hahahaha! No more wondering: it’s done.

* __[22-Dec-2287]__ Rolling solo didn’t go well. Jesus-fucking-christ I swear I nearly bayonetted Trashcan Carla, by the Gorski cottage. I was all pumped up and stabby, and she was there. I managed to cover the barely-aborted attempt up, but it was awkward. She’s still weird with me. 

    I escorted her to Sanctuary, fuck she’s a dumb cunt. She sold me a perfectly good basketball for *FOUR* CAPS, not ten seconds after walking past my newly erected basketball court. How does she not know these things go together? I would have paid 100 caps. Who are these people? 

    At least the sticky paste greeting us at the minuteman bridge was reassuring. Carla even commented on it.

* __[23-Dec-2287]__ Welp, Preston Garvey officially declared me ‘General’ of the Minutemen. Somehow, this made me lose even more respect for him. If only he knew how I almost disemboweled his favourite trader yesterday. If only he knew a lot of shit.

    I don’t really want to leave him in Sanctuary, so I asked that he accompany me on expeditions. I don’t like how he sort of acts like he’s somehow responsible there. Also, he is actually a good shot, and that laser rifle is pretty serious business. Maybe our security gate will actually stay closed, too

* __[24-Dec-2287]__ Preston Garvey’s motherfucking hat. We got into an argument, I took it, I gave it back. Now he’s not wearing it out of spite, so I have to look at his dumb head. Also, he keeps bitching at me to clean up the co-op. Jesus, if settling it is so important, go right ahead. Why does everyone look to me to do the most basic shit? 

    Fuck I hate Preston.I have actually purposefully been doing other shit just to fuck with him. On the plus side, he’s a rabid moralist, and he constantly analyses every single fucking thing I do. Yes, his bullshit is tiresome, but as with Codsworth, I do find it keeps me grounded. Still, part of me looks forward to his untimely death.

## Entry 3: [25-Dec-2287] Ho ho ho, merry fucking Christmas...

* ...six palettes of concrete in a junkyard shipping container; think of the fortifications we could build with this! Hrm, what should I use this for? The co-op, perhaps? Nah! Let’s use it to make Tenpine Tower! Yeah the Paula’s aren’t going to like it, but they can take a hike. Woohoo the view is going to be glorious. Sorry Preston, but General’s word goes. Suck shit.

* __[26-Dec-2287]__ Ok, have to adjust expectations. I have a lot of concrete, but not enough to build a ‘tower’. It’s still going to be grand, though; perhaps four storeys, raised off the ground, on concrete pillars. We’ll limit entry points to one or two of the columns, which’ll make for nice defensive chokepoints. We will have to leave the crops relatively unguarded with this approach, but I’ll install a fortified balcony overlooking them, so we can at least harry raiders from within the fortress if they go for the tato plants.

* __[27-Dec-2287]__ I just literally stumbled upon a full suit of t51 power armour. Did no-one seriously think to scavenge the highway? I think the radiation might have had a detrimental effect on the faculaties on these ‘survivors’. Unbelievable.

* __[28-Dec-2287]__ Fuck shit fuck. Dogpaste and Sticky Joe are back. Sorta. mutilate bits of them are reforming from the gore. Is it them? Who is doing this to me?! I can’t. I just. Fuck it, from now I cross downriver at the ford. I can’t take this. I can bring chugchug. I’m always safe with chugchug. Chugchugchugchug.

* __[29-Dec-2288]__ Abernathy’s got their other daughter kidnapped by some Raider named Clutch. Fucking how? Do they just not use any of the fortifications I built them? Do they not want daughters? I wonder if I could build scaffolding all the way to the top of that pylon…

    Decided to cut deep into the urban wasteland to retrieve the Abernathy girl. Of course we get intercepted by a squad of super mutants three steps out of Concord. Christ, my power armour is fucked. 

    Moved on to defuse a situation at the Drumlin diner. Preston was pleased at the peaceful resolution. Can’t help but feel we’dve been better of killing someone. But who? Going to crash at Drumlin for now, see what I can do to jury rig chugchug back into serviceability. 

* __[31-Dec-2287]__ Good tidings for new year’s eve: construction at Tenpines is coming along swimmingly. We scavenged half of College square (above ground), but got so much scrap that we’ve been forced to come back to Tenpines to drop off the takings, rest, and go at it again. Any objections the Paulas had to our ‘expansion’ of Tenpines evaporated when they saw Preston and I returning from College Station, literally dripping with radioactive ghoul giblets, carting no less that 500 pounds of scrap. One less problem to deal with. Oh, and I found a Mr Jangles spaceman plushie in a crashed airliner on the way back! Shaun is going to love it; will have to drop it in the crib at Sanctuary tomorrow, before cleaning up the rest of College square.

* __[01-Jan-2288]__ Just found four fusion cores! Time to get my Chug on.

* __[02-Jan-2288]__ Dear diary, today was huge; Preston and I went back to College square this morning, after dropping by Sanctuary as planned, (side note: I swear Mama Murphy hasn’t moved an inch from her fucking chair - she was fucking nodding on med-x when we arrived, not later that 9am. Someone needs to do something about that junkie layabout). Anyway, while we were clearing out the remainder of the terraces around College Square, we picked up a military radio signal, and heard a gunfight the block over. 

    Turns out there’s some soldiers in the former police station - yes, ‘soldiers,’ these people were definitely military. Preston immediately recognised them as the ‘Brotherhood of Steel’ - some kind of tech’d-up underground militia. He fucking hates them, and makes no secret of it, (which immediately made me like them). After some guilt tripping, I get him to agree to help them with their feral problem. 

    They’re quite the characters, unlike pretty much everyone else I’ve met in the wasteland so far. Quite military, but not in the real, pre-war sense. They’re being led by ‘Paladin (yes, really) Danse’, who took an immediate liking to me after I demonstrated basic aptitude for combat operations. 

    Preston is whining like a five-year-old at this point, but caves and agrees to subsequently help with busting into a factory ruin for some signals equipment. While Preston bitches, Danse just gets on with the job. Turns out that the ‘Brotherhood of Steel’ isn’t even weirdest club I’d learn about today, the factory is filled with android ‘Synths’ belonging to some secret society calling themselves ‘the Institute’ (without a shred of irony). 

    At the end of it all, Danse actually tries to recruit me. What I would give for a photo of Preston’s stuttering face at this moment. Almost made me accept right there. I told him I’d think about it. Truth is, I’m really coming to enjoy this leadership thing. Yes, sure, I hate the people, but building and defending a growing network of settlements is a real challenge, and welcome distraction from… all this. 

    Also, I don’t know the first fucking thing about this ‘brotherhood’ but I am getting definite whackjob vibes from them, and that’s speaking from *my* goddamned state of mind. I won’t rule it out; it’s good to keep Preston hungry for my approval, but for now I need to focus on building up Tenpines Bluff and Abernathy Farm: food, drinks, electricity, a basketball team - there’s a lot of work to be done for each. Oh yeah, and I totally decided to bolt a tower to the side of that electricity pylon they’re camped under. 

* __[03-Jan-2288]__ Sturges asked if he could tinker with the t45 suit we found at the museum of freedom, now that I have a t51 suit. I knew it. Ever since I moved it to the locked garage at Red Rocket, he’s been shiftless - his pointless hammering seems to have intensified, and become more… pointed.

* __[04-Jan-2287]__ When Preston and I had been making our way to rescue Lucy (who I strongly suspect might have ‘rescued’ herself, had we left it to her), we came across the ruins of College Square stations. The place was carnage, looked like some raiders had fortified the plaza, but got overrun by ghouls. That’s going to mean a lot of loot, if we can deal with the ferals. It’s going to be a gay old time. I’ve stripped and cleaned my shotgun, and attached a bayonet; the perfect weapon for when they come in close for a kiss. I’ve gotta admit, I’m excited.
